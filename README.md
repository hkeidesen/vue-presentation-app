Presentation app that will host weather forecast and viewed in the social zone at the office (DNV Trondheim)

Use npm/yarn install to install the dependencies 

For local development it is recommended to use json-server (or similar) and host the weather data. This will ensure that you are not calling an external API everytime the code changes and reloads. To run a local API host, run "npm run backend"
